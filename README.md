# Lootin - BackEnd Application

## About The Project
Here is the Lootin's BackEnd application which follows a REST architecture.
It contains all the "reflection" behind the Front application and ensures the connection to the SQL database.

### Developed with
* [Java](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/windows/javadoc.html)
* [Spring-Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
* [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/fr/)

## Getting Started
### Requirements
For building and running the application you need:
- [JDK 1.11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)
- [Maven 3](https://maven.apache.org)

### Clone the Repository
As usual, you get started by cloning the project to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/Lootin-IGM/BackEnd.git
```

### Create MySQL Database
To use Lootin, you must create a database named "lootin" and create a user with all the rights on it having for login: "lootin" and for password "lootin".

### Running the application locally

There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the `main` method in the `src/main/java/fr/uge/lootin/back/LootinApplication` class from your IDE.
